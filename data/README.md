# Data

This repository does not include the dataset due to size/privacy constraints.

## Dataset source
This project uses the **PhysioNet 2019 Sepsis Challenge** dataset (patient time-series stored as `.psv` files).

## Expected folder structure
data/
raw/
physionet2019/
training_setA/
p000001.psv
p000002.psv
...
processed/ # generated by preprocessing (not committed)

## How to reproduce results
1) Download the PhysioNet 2019 Sepsis Challenge dataset.
2) Put the `.psv` files under:
   - `data/raw/physionet2019/training_setA/`
3) Run preprocessing to generate `data/processed/`:
   - `notebooks/02_preprocessing.ipynb`
4) Train and evaluate:
   - `notebooks/03_model_lstm.ipynb`
   - `notebooks/04_model_gru.ipynb`
   - `notebooks/05_model_transformer.ipynb`
   - `notebooks/06_evaluation.ipynb`

## Notes
- Raw and processed data are excluded from Git tracking via `.gitignore`.
- Several notebooks support running on a subset of patients for faster iteration
  (e.g., `N_PATIENTS = 5000` during EDA).
